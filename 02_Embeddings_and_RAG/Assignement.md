# Assignment 2

#### ❓Question #1:

The default embedding dimension of `text-embedding-3-small` is 1536, as noted above. 

1. Is there any way to modify this dimension?
2. What technique does OpenAI use to achieve this?

> NOTE: Check out this [API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create) for the answer to question #1, and [this documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases) for an answer to question #2!

#### ❓Question #2:

What are the benefits of using an `async` approach to collecting our embeddings?

> NOTE: Determining the core difference between `async` and `sync` will be useful! If you get stuck - ask ChatGPT!
#### ❓ Question #3:

When calling the OpenAI API - are there any ways we can achieve more reproducible outputs?

> NOTE: Check out [this section](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/) of the OpenAI documentation for the answer!
#### ❓ Question #4:

What prompting strategies could you use to make the LLM have a more thoughtful, detailed response?

What is that strategy called?

### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Enhance your RAG application in some way! 

Suggestions are: 

- Allow it to work with PDF files
- Implement a new distance metric
- Add metadata support to the vector database

While these are suggestions, you should feel free to make whatever augmentations you desire! 

> NOTE: These additions might require you to work within the `aimakerspace` library - that's expected!
